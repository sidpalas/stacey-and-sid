Hi everyone! (and if not 'everyone', then at least Hi Dad!)

Welcome to our blog! Sid and I are about to embark on 2+ months of travel throughout Asia and will be sharing our updates here. Aside from a short trip to Tokyo with friends in 2015 and my two week stint in India for research during grad school, neither of us has spent much time in any Asian countries, so we're counting on this trip to be a grand adventure!

If you're reading this and have thoughts, recommendations, or opinions on things that we should see, do, eat, or experience, please tell us about them! We are open to any and all traveling suggestions! 

-Stacey
